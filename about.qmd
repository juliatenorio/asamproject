## Project Layout 

Topic: U.S. influence on the Education System in the Philippines \n

Project Proposal: Conduct an interview with an individual(s) that has had experience with having a post-secondary education in the Philippines and create a website that demonstrates family history and roots. \n   

Key Questions: 
What is the impact on the education in the Philippines with U.S. influences? 
What are the main goals of having the U.S. oversee Filipino education? 
How accessible is education for Filipino families of different socioeconomic backgrounds? What kind of educational systems are there in the Philippines? 
How does having education in the Philippines affect views/perspectives on the U.S. once people immigrate there?
